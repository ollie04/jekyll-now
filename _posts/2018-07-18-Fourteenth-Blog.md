  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by focusing on my work, and when I was stuck referencing to the hint, before questioning with the person sat next to me in order to get the answer. I also think that I used previous knowledge on tasks to really gain full understanding and complete it using a good variety in code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I packed up two minutes earlier than I should have on the computer which I should not have done.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will pack up at the actual time and not earlier as I missed out on doing one more exercise.</td>
