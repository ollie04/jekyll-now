    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by focusing on my work, and when I was stuck referencing to the hint, before questioning with the person sat next to me in order to get the answer.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I spoke to people for too long and off topic which meant that I distracted my own learning.</td>
