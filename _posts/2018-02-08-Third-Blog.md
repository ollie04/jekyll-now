    <td>The strategies which were effective were an element of teamwork to start off with as it required a bit of guidance from a classmate if I put a bit of incorrect. Also I put very specific code in in my work which enabled the best outcome possible. I went beyond the task as I showed the screen saying 'I', changing to a heart and then moving to a moving alien which looked cool.</td>
