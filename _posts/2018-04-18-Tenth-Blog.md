    <th>Starting point:</th>
    <td>The starting point for today's lesson was to complete any tasks or assessments before doing the task for the final lesson day of the term.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>The target was to complete the robot arms task where we coded the most code we have done into the computer, and have all numbered keys from 1 to 0 on the keyboard getting the robot to do different roles. For example: spin around, raise arm, lower body etc..</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>

    <th>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt and was successful in this lesson by being very precise and correct with the code I inserted into the computer, this included the spelling of certain words and the usage of capital letters for different computing terms, which sounds a bit easier when reading to actually executing the task. I was proved to have done the code correctly as I was able to pick up my keys from my desk using the robot arms which was really cool and really rewarding after all of the hard work coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I honestly do not think anything limited my learning today, and I have a really positive outlook into what I achieved in today's lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will work in the exact same manner as I did today, and then I will be able to achieve as close to my full potential as possible.</td>
