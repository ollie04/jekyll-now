    <th>Starting point:</th>
    <td>To complete any code on the Fuze Box which was not achieved in the previous week.</td>

    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>To make the LDR function through the coding on the Fuze Box.</td>

    <th>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td>Eventually I was able to reach my target of making the LDR function, however it was a really tough challenge and it took a relatively long time to achieve it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by referencing to the book on a few occasions to gain details including where it would be located on the Fuze Board, however this was a bit of a challenge in itself as it only showed where one of its metal pieces would go, which meant that I had to try and interpret where it would go, as well as having an element of trial and error, but this indicated me having a good mindset and dedication to my learning, which definitely helped me complete the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that the task was not clearly illustrated within the Fuze Book, which meant that the task was more time consuming as it required a lot more trial and error than I believe it could and should have taken.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I could potentially have been a bit more efficient and logical in where I positioned the LDR instead of not having much of a sequence and methodology in how I solved it.</td>
  </tr>
