    <td>I learnt by taking Mr Keen's really helpful advice for when coding this. It was to read the example fully and examine the text explaining it fully in order to not make any mistakes and progress as quick as possible. I was able to achieve numerous steps to a section in one attempt of the code, which aided me to get on to the more challenging tasks of the first task.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I do not think that my learning was limited during the lesson, I think I had full concentration and was fully engaged in the new topic that we were learning.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will have the same attitude and focus towards Python and I would suspect I will make just a good progress.</td>
