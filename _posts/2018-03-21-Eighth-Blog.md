    <th>Starting point:</th>
    <td>To show our Github website to our teacher (Mr Cullen) and get feedback from him about the content of writing about all previous lessons on how to improve them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>The target was to make improvements to our write ups and appearance of our blogs to a very pleasing level in preparation for when we hand them in next week. Also, to do the next assessment on the Fuze Box when we finish the first task. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td>I was able to reach the target in regards to our blogs, but was unsuccessful with the Fuze Box.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by taking a lot of advice on board from Mr Cullen in order to try and achieve the best grade possible next week when they are handed in. By the end of the lesson, I made excellent progress within the work and I am very proud of myself and have confidence when submitting my work. I also used my resources well by accessing websites for additional code to up the quality, it was very beneficial.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that the two Fuze Boxes that I tried to plug in to various computers during the lesson were all unsuccessful to start up which lead to me being limited from twenty minutes of coding on the LEDs which was rather frustrating. This however was not through any form of personal error, it was simply just yet again another technical error, which was occurred on two different elements of three different Fuze Boxes during the last two lessons. This is slightly frustrating but truly unavoidable on my behalf. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will yet again have to hope that the Fuze Box is fully functioning, or maybe join a group of three to complete the work, even though it would make it slightly heavy on the numbers side, but I would get the opportunity to code.</td>
