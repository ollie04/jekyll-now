    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete work on the Fuze Box and make a never ending code where it shows a message which changes every time from a variable.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by being very precise with my work and relaying the code wrote down in the Fuze Book, as well building on my previous code and adding layers to build more complexity to the work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was doing too much coding on my Github website and not enough on the task set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will have more dedication towards the task set on the Fuze Box and do more work on my blog at home. </td>
