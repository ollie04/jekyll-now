    <th>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by being very precise with my work and relaying the code wrote down in the Fuze Book, as well building on my previous code and adding layers to build more complexity to the work.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was doing too much coding on my Github website and not enough on the task set.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will have more dedication towards the task set on the Fuze Box and do more work on my blog at home. </td>
