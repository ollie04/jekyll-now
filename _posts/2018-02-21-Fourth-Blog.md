  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by working with very good detail and mindset when using the Fuze Box, as well as having an element of creativity to my work. In terms of the blog post, I started off okay making good alterations and style changes to the website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was the fact that I deleted my posts section of code by mistake, meaning that I would not be able to ever post on my website. Therefore I had to delete the entire repository which made all my homework and lesson work a total waste of time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>next time, I will be a bit more cautious and think about every click of a button before I make it in order to assure that it is a logical decision and not a stupid one.</td>
  </tr>
