    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Make another game, but this time it was a number declining one where it would say 'If we had 6 apples and one was eaten, we would have 5 left.' This would be in a never ending sequence.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking at the code I did in a similar task last lesson, and I implemented the same by more and new code in order to make an improvement from the work in the previous lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that I was slightly distracted when it started snowing during the lesson and I started talking about unnecessary things and generally got a bit excited.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be a bit more focused on my learning and zone out from any other distractions in order to achieve the most possible within one hour.</td>
