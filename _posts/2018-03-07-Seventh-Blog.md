  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking at the code in the book and relaying it with detail, as well as having a good mindset to try and look for individual elements ro change until the code was finally successful. The example for this is that the code was not working as the word 'age' did not have a capital letter.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that the Fuze Box was not working to its full capabilities so that slowed us up on this task today.</td>

    <td>Next time I will just have to hope that the Fuze Box I choose out the box is a good one and not a slightly glitchy one.</td>
