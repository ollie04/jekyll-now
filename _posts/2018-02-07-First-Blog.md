    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The strategies which were effective was being very specific and following all of the things like in the booklet so that I knew that I would not be cutting any corners and get them all correct. I also altered some of the variable things to show an element of creativity too which shows a versatility in my mindset.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One thing which limited my learning was doing my Github coding instead of the Fuzebox for the first five to ten minutes which put me at a disadvantage.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I will change for next time is starting the work right from the start so that I could potentially get on to extra things at the end of the lesson.</td>
